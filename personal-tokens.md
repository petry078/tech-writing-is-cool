# Personal Tokens

Personal Tokens are authentication methods that allow you to use Azion Real-Time Manager commands through the command-line interface (CLI).

To configure a personal token, you need an Azion Real-Time Manager account. [Create one here.](https://manager.azion.com/signup)

Login into your account and click on **Personal Tokens** from the **Account** menu, in the top right corner.

Click on **Add a personal token** and choose a name, an expiration date (can be 1, 7, 15, or 30 days or 1 year), and an optional description.

Then, click on **Create Token**.

## Utilizing Personal Tokens

Created tokens are available through the **visibility icon** on the Personal Token page. Click on the **copy token** icon to copy it to your clipboard.

Personal Tokens are sensitive data, and you should treat them just like passwords. They are not going to be visible after you click the **Ok** button.

> Created Personal Tokens can be deleted, but not modified. All created tokens show *scope*, *last modified* date, and *expiration* date to help you manage them.

## Delete a Personal Token

If you are not using a Personal Token anymore, you should delete it.

To do it, access your Real-Time Manager account, and click on **Personal Tokens** from the **Account** menu, in the top right corner.

Hover your mouse over the Personal Token you want to delete and click on the **thrash can** icon.

A verification pop-up will appear. Type **delete** to confirm, and click on the **Delete*8 button.

You will see a deletion message after that.
