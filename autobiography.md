# Autobiography

## A very personal introduction

Hello, there! My name is Guilherme M. Petry, I'm a 25 years old journalist, tech writer and web developer. I'm well involved with information, data and computers and love it more each day. I also do some carpentry with my dad, just for fun. 

Making things with wood is hard work, you really have to feel and respect the materials. Sometimes the wood is just not ready for it and not gonna work well. Understanding this helped me a lot, especially when I feel anxious. It's nice to feel ready, but absolutely necessary to respect yourself when needed.

I was born in Campo Grande - Mato Grosso do Sul. I come from a scientific family. My parents are both academic researchers and teachers. My father is a chemist and my mother teaches mathematics. Well, not any more, she retired a few years ago. My sister is a chemical engineer, she followed the family career and studies the same thing as my father, renewable energy.

Well, enough of my background. Let's talk business!

## Young adult

When I was 17, just finished high school, moved to SÃ£o Paulo to study and work. I wanted to be a journalist and work with information, media and communication. But, different from my colleagues, who were only interested in football and politics, I decided to specialize in what I liked most, technology and computers.

So, I contacted the editors of all technology publications in the country, until I got (still in college) my first opportunity, covering the technology market for Computerworld Brazil.

That was a nice experience, learned a lot. Unfortunately, the company responsible for the website decided to close its operations and, with that, the contract of its employees.

I stayed focused and soon found other jobs at Tecmundo, MegaCurioso, Showmetech, UOL, The Hack and others. I also worked with general content production for blogs, teaching materials and even SEO.

## The plot twist

As a tech journalist, I've always had a lot of contact with technical documents and software documentation. Anyone in this market knows, sometimes these materials, usually produced by technical professionals, to be complicated and in some cases even illegible.

However, I've always been interested in the level of depth these contents deliver and I decided, I'm going to do it! But to do that, just an interest in technology was not enough. Technical knowledge is required, and although I have been studying amateur programming since 2018, it was time to take it more seriously.

At the end of 2021, I passed an intensive full stack web development course, quit my job and really dove in.

After more than 600 hours of study and practice, several projects developed and a lot of head banging on the keyboard, I returned to software documentation studies and here I am.

I believe that a good software documentation is a text committed to the information, without rambling, without literature, just information, delivered in a simple and direct way, that leaves no room for double interpretation. But also, it can't be complicated, it should be accessible and really help users.

This is what I believe in and what I work for.
